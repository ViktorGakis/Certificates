## Unsupervised Machine Learning for Stock Portfolio Analysis

This is the final course that demonstrates the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, to analyze stock portfolios. The main goal is to group stocks within the S&P 500 index and identify similarities, patterns, or properties among them.

## Context
In Quantitative Finance, machine learning algorithms are often used to analyze stock portfolios and identify patterns or similarities among stocks. Clustering algorithms, in particular, can group stocks and provide insights into the relationships within indexes or portfolios.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to apply clustering algorithms to the stocks contained in the S&P 500 index, optimize the algorithms, and gain further insights into how stocks can be grouped within the index.

## Project Overview
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The Jupyter Notebook (Unsupervised_Machine_Learning.ipynb) guides the user through the process of data exploration, preprocessing, and the application of unsupervised learning algorithms.

1. Dimensionality Reduction: The dataset is reduced in dimensionality using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to retain the essential information while reducing the number of features.

1. Clustering Algorithms: The data is clustered using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method and Silhouette analysis.

1. Visualization: The results are visualized using various plotting techniques to better understand the dataset's structure and the relationships among the data points.

1. Analysis: Analyze the properties, patterns, and similarities of the groups of stocks within the S&P 500 index.
