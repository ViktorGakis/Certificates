## Final Project for the course

### Context

A lot of ways to analyse a portfolio in Quant Finance is using Machine Learning algorithms in order to group the stocks and find further similarities. Clustering algorithms perform exactly this task and are vastly used in order to identify patterns or properties of group of stocks within indexes or portfolios.


### Goal

In this project, we will apply clustering algorithms in the stocks contained in the S&P500 index. The goal is to optimize our clustering algorithms and gain further insight on how the stocks are can be grouped within S&P500.
