# [IBM Supervised Machine Learning: Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-classification?specialization=ibm-machine-learning)

## About this Course

This course introduces you to one of the main types of modeling families of supervised Machine Learning: Classification. You will learn how to train predictive models to classify categorical outcomes and how to use error metrics to compare across different models. The hands-on section of this course focuses on using best practices for classification, including train and test splits, and handling data sets with unbalanced classes.

By the end of this course you should be able to:
- Differentiate uses and applications of classification and classification ensembles
- Describe and use logistic regression models
- Describe and use decision tree and tree-ensemble models
- Describe and use other ensemble methods for classification
- Use a variety of error metrics to compare and select the classification model that best suits your data
- Use oversampling and undersampling as techniques to handle unbalanced classes in a data set
 
This course is divived into 6 modules:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K Nearest Neighbors
3. Support Vector Machines
4. Decision Trees
5. Ensemble Models
6. Modeling Unbalanced Classes
